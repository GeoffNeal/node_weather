#Node weather app

##Overview

**An app that uses Angular and Express to collect up-to-date information on any city the user searches for.**

---

###Installation

To use this app you must have Node.js and npm installed.

You can then run:

	npm install

whilst in the root directory to download dependencies.

Once that's done, run the command:

	node src/server.js

and the server should be running on **localhost:3000**.

---

###Usage

At the moment this is still being developed but the basic functionality works, simply type the name of a city into the search bar and hit the **return** key or click the **search** button.

A graph should appear with weather data *(temperature by default)* on that city and there will also be a summary of the data alongside the graph.
